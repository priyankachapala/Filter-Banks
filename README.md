# Filter Banks

Theory<br />
In Digital  Signal Processing often there is a need to decompose signals into  low and high frequency bands, after which they need to be combined to reconstruct the original signal. Such an example is found in sub-band coding (SBC).The 2-channel filter bank is also known as Quadrature Mirror Filter (QMF) Banks since they use power complementary filters. 

The block diagram for 2-channel filter bank with down sampling and up sampling by 2 is as shown below
